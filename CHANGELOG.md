# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) and [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com).

## [3.0.1] - 2019-10-24

### Added

* PHP 7.4 CI pipeline and docker-compose environment
* Explicitly set `error_reporting=-1` for CI and tests in order to capture deprecation warnings

### Fixed

* Replace usage of curly brace syntax for accessing string offsets, which is deprecated in PHP 7.4 - [#51] 

## [3.0.0] - 2019-07-29

**Please take notice of the backwards incompatible changes (BC breaks) documented below 
in the changelog of [3.0.0-alpha](#300-alpha---2019-04-30) & [3.0.0-beta](#300-beta---2019-06-24).**

### Added

* Reserved private constant for ABORT_REQUEST instruction for future use
* Socket ID is now represented and generated by a proper type class

### Improved

* Import of root namespace functions
* Dependency injection for socket implementation

## [3.0.0-beta] - 2019-06-24

### Backwards incompatible changes (BC breaks)

* The socket conection parameter was **moved** from the `Client`'s constructor to

  * `Client#sendRequest(ConfiguresSocketConnection $connection, ProvidesRequestData $request) : ProvidesResponseData` and
  * `Client#sendAsyncRequest(ConfiguresSocketConnection $connection, ProvidesRequestData $request) : int`  

  in order to allow sending (equal) requests to different FastCGI servers using the same `Client` instance. - [#45]

* Removed method `ProvidesResponseData#getRequestId() : int` and `Response#getRequestId() : int` resepctivly in order 
  to avoid confusion about the semantics of the term "request ID" and misusage by assuming it is a unique ID for each request (which it is not).
  Also the first constructor parameter of the `Response` class was removed wiht this change. - [#39]
  
* Renamed all `$requestId(s)` parameters to `$socketId(s)` in order to reflect the correct semantics of the ID. - [#39]

* Renamed method `Client#getRequestIdsHavingResponse() : array<int>` to `Client#getSocketIdsHavingResponse() : array<int>` in order to reflect 
  the correct semantics of the returned array of IDs. - [#39] 

## [3.0.0-alpha] - 2019-04-30

### Backwards incompatible changes (BC breaks)

* Method `Response#getHeaders() : array` will now return a two-dimensional array with grouped values to support 
  multi-value headers. Previous versions returned a one-dimensional key-value array.
  ```php
  # Previous versions
  [
    'Status' => 'HTTP/2 200 OK',
    'Set-Cookie' => 'tasty_cookie=strawberry',
  ]

  # Since 3.0.0-alpha
  [
    'Status' => [
      'HTTP/2 200 OK',
    ],
    'Set-Cookie' => [
      'yummy_cookie=choco',
      'tasty_cookie=strawberry',
    ],
  ]
  ```
  
* Method `Response#getHeader(string $headerKey) : array` will now return an array containing all values for the given 
  header key to support multi-value headers. Previous versions returned the last value as a string.
  ```php
  echo $response->getHeader('Set-Cookie');
  
  # Previous versions
  'tasty_cookie=strawberry'

  # Since 3.0.0-alpha
  [
    'yummy_cookie=choco',
    'tasty_cookie=strawberry'
  ]
  ```

* Method `Response#getRawResponse() : string` is no longer available and its usage must be replaced with `Response#getOutput()`.
  The method was deprecated since version [2.6.0](#260---2019-04-02).

### Added

* Method `Response#getHeaderLine(string $headerKey) : string` that returns all values, separated by comma, for the given key. - [#35]
* Header keys are now case-insensitive in `Response#getHeader(string $headerKey) : array` and `Response#getHeaderLine(string $headerKey) : string`. - [#35]

### Removed

* Method `Response#getRawResponse() : string` that was deprecated in version [2.6.0](#260---2019-04-02) in favour of `Response#getOutput() : string`. - [#36]

## [2.7.2] - 2019-05-31

### Improved

* Handling of `stream_select` returning `false` in case of a system call interrupt. - [#41]

### Fixed

* Remove/close sockets after fetching their responses triggered async requests in order to prevent halt on further 
  request processing, if the number of requests exceeds php-fpm's `pm.max_children` setting. - [#40]

## [2.7.1] - 2019-04-29

### Fixed

* Remove failed sockets from internal collection that errored out during reading of response in order to prevent infinite 
  tries/re-use of those failed connections. - [#37]

## [2.7.0] - 2019-04-28

### Added

* Re-using of idle sockets for successive requests - [#33]

## [2.6.0] - 2019-04-02

### Added

* Two new methods to Response class - [#27]
  * `Response#getOutput()` which is identical to `Response#getRawResponse()` and will return the complete output from 
     the `STDOUT` stream of the response.
  * `Response#getError()` which will return the complete output of the `STDERR` stream of the response. 

* Second parameter `$errorBuffer` in tha pass through callback signature - [#27]
  ```php
  $callback = function( string $outputBuffer, string $errorBuffer ) {};
  ```
  This parameter will contain the contents of the `STDERR` stream packets.
  
### Deprecated

* `Response#getRawResponse()` in favour of consistant naming. This method will be removed in `v3.0.0` - [#27]

### Removed

* `ProcessManagerException` that was introduced in `v2.5.0` - [#27]
  Please read [this blog post](https://hollo.me/php/background-info-fast-cgi-client-v2.6.0.html) why this (BC breaking) change was necessary 
  and how to handle server-sent errors now.

### Fixed

* `bin/fcgiget` to accept full URL paths and print STDOUT and STDERR output

### Improved

* Documentation

## [2.5.0] - 2019-01-29

### Added

* New `ProcessManagerException` in case the php-fpm responds with packages of type `STDERR`.
  This refers mainly to the error `Primary script unknown` resp. the response `File not found.`.
  - [#26] 
  
* CI builds for PHP 7.3

## [2.4.3] - 2018-09-17

### Fixes

* Value of Client::STREAM_SELECT_USEC was to low with `20000` and was updated to `200000` as 
  [recommended in the official PHP documentation](http://php.net/stream_select#tv_sec). - [#20]

## [2.4.2] - 2018-01-28

### Fixes

* Missing data in `php://input` on worker side when client sends content larger than 65535 bytes - [#15]

## [2.4.1] - 2017-11-19

### Fixes

* PHP warning when trying to get ready request IDs - [#14]

### Improves

* Loop performance 

## [2.4.0] - 2017-09-28

### Added

* Ability to add pass through callbacks in order to access output buffer from a long running callee - [#11]  
  See an [example in the documentation](./README.md#reading-output-buffer-from-worker-script-using-pass-through-callbacks) for further informaiton.

## [2.3.0] - 2017-06-15

### Changed

* Replaced methods `getHost()` and `getPort()` with `getSocketAddress()` in interface `hollodotme\FastCGI\Interfaces\ConfiguresSocketConnection` - [#9]
* The transport protocol `unix://` must be omitted for the first parameter of `hollodotme\FastCGI\SocketConnections\UnixDomainSocket`  
  Only the socket path must be passed. - [#9]
* Replaced `fsockopen()` with `stream_socket_client()` for connecting to php-fpm. - [#9]

## [2.2.0] - 2017-04-15

### Added

* Method `addResponseCallbacks(callable ...$callbacks)` to all request classes to enable response evaluation delegation - [#6]
* Method `addFailureCallbacks(callable ...$callbacks)` to all request classes to enable exception handling delegation
* Method `readResponse(int $requestId, ?int $timeoutMs = null) : ProvidesResponseData` to read and retrieve a single response
* Method `readResponses(?int $imeoutMs = null, int ...$requestIds) : \Generator` to read and yield multiple responses
* Method `readReadyResponses(?int $imeoutMs = null) : \Generator` to check for ready responses, read and yield them
* Method `waitForResponses(?int $timeout = null)` to `Client` class for waiting for multiple responses and calling the respective response callbacks - [#5]
* Method `getRequestIdsHavingResponse() : array` to enable reactive read of responses as they occur
* Method `hasUnhandledResponses() : bool` to check for outstanding responses
* Method `handleResponse(int $requestId, ?int $timeoutMs = null)` to fetch a specific response and notify the respective response callback
* Method `handleResponses(?int $timeoutMs = null, int ...$requestIds)` to fetch a specific responses and notify the respective response callbacks
* Method `handleReadyResponses(?int $timeoutMs = null)` to check for ready responses, fetch them and notify the respective response callbacks

### Changed

* Method `waitForResponse(int $requestId, ?int $timeoutMs = null)` is not returning a response anymore, but will call the response callback  
  Use `readResponse(int $requestId, ?int $timeoutMs = null): ProvidesResponseData` if you want to get the response directly.

### Removed

* Optional flag to make a connection persistent (is now always disabled in favour of better timeout handling and FPM pool-children-scalability)
* Optional flag to keep the server-side connection alive (is now always enabled, affects only network sockets)

### Improved

* Code coverage by automated integration tests
* Timeout handling on multiple requests
