# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) and [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com).

## [4.0.0] - t.b.d

* `AbstractRequest::content` now takes an instance of ComposesRequestContent. Strings can no longer be passed directly as content. Select one of the implementations: JsonData, MultipartFormData or UrlEncodedFormData, or create your own by implementing the interface.
* `AbstractRequest::content` is now nullable. You can create a request with just a scriptFileName and no content.
* `AbstractRequest->setContent()` is removed. Making the request content immutable once set in the constructor.


## [3.1.7] - 2021-12-07

* Make sure length values are within valid bounds

## [3.1.6] - 2021-09-23

### Added

* PHP 8.1 comaptibility

## [3.1.5] - 2020-12-10

### Fixed

* Transfer of multipart/form-data blocks - [#64]
  * Removes base64 encoding for contents of files to transfer
  * Removes `Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64` header from multipart block for files
  * Improves determination of file's MIME type via `mime_content_type()`, if available
  * Adds tests for multipart transfer of files with binary content (images)

## [3.1.4] - 2020-11-23

### Added

* PHP 8.1 compatibility
* Makefile to run all tests based on docker-compose config

### Fixed

* TypeError on PHP 8 for a resource that is neither `null` nor a `resource`
* Added ext-xdebug as dev-requirement in composer.json
* Xdebug 3 coverage filter constant name for PHP 8

### Replaced

### Removed

* CI Builds on Circle-CI

## [3.1.3] - 2020-08-13

### Fixed

* Remove broken sockets from socket collection if writing the request to stream fails - [#61]
* Do not export `docker-compose.yml` with composer archives via `.gitattributes`
* Stabilize unreliable tests with signaled pool processes

## [3.1.2] - 2020-05-19

### Added

* `.gitattributes` file to exclude non-relevant files/directories from archives/releases installed by composer - [#58]

### Fixed

* Remove link to `bin/fcgiget` in `composer.json` as it is a potential security issue (because `bin/fcgiget` accepts any
  accessible fastCGI endpoint and may be exposed in some setups)

## [3.1.1] - 2020-05-06

### Fixed

* Backwards compatibility break in userland classes extending `AbstractRequest` due to a final constructor. - [#56]
  See also: [#55]

## [3.1.0] - 2020-05-06

### Added

* Interface for request content composers with implementations for URL encoded form-data, multipart form-data and JSON
  data. This was inspired by - [#53]
* Named constructor `newWithRequestContent` to all request classes in order to simplify the use of the new request
  content type composers.
* For more information and examples have a look at the documentation
  section ["Request contents"](./README.md#request-contents).

### Fixed

* Inspection issues found by PHPStan

### Updated

* Test suites to cover PHP versions from 7.1 to 7.4
* License dates
* CI moved to GitHub actions

## [3.0.1] - 2019-10-24

### Added

* PHP 7.4 CI pipeline and docker-compose environment
* Explicitly set `error_reporting=-1` for CI and tests in order to capture deprecation warnings

### Fixed

* Replace usage of curly brace syntax for accessing string offsets, which is deprecated in PHP 7.4 - [#51]

## [3.0.0] - 2019-07-29

**Please take notice of the backwards incompatible changes (BC breaks) documented below in the changelog
of [3.0.0-alpha](#300-alpha---2019-04-30) & [3.0.0-beta](#300-beta---2019-06-24).**

### Added

* Reserved private constant for ABORT_REQUEST instruction for future use
* Socket ID is now represented and generated by a proper type class

### Improved

* Import of root namespace functions
* Dependency injection for socket implementation

## [3.0.0-beta] - 2019-06-24

### Backwards incompatible changes (BC breaks)

* The socket conection parameter was **moved** from the `Client`'s constructor to

  * `Client#sendRequest(ConfiguresSocketConnection $connection, ProvidesRequestData $request) : ProvidesResponseData`
    and
  * `Client#sendAsyncRequest(ConfiguresSocketConnection $connection, ProvidesRequestData $request) : int`

  in order to allow sending (equal) requests to different FastCGI servers using the same `Client` instance. - [#45]

* Removed method `ProvidesResponseData#getRequestId() : int` and `Response#getRequestId() : int` respectively in order
  to avoid confusion about the semantics of the term "request ID" and misusage by assuming it is a unique ID for each
  request (which it is not). Also the first constructor parameter of the `Response` class was removed with this change.
  - [#39]

* Renamed all `$requestId(s)` parameters to `$socketId(s)` in order to reflect the correct semantics of the ID. - [#39]

* Renamed method `Client#getRequestIdsHavingResponse() : array<int>`
  to `Client#getSocketIdsHavingResponse() : array<int>` in order to reflect the correct semantics of the returned array
  of IDs. - [#39]

## [3.0.0-alpha] - 2019-04-30

### Backwards incompatible changes (BC breaks)

* Method `Response#getHeaders() : array` will now return a two-dimensional array with grouped values to support
  multi-value headers. Previous versions returned a one-dimensional key-value array.
  ```php
  # Previous versions
  [
    'Status' => 'HTTP/2 200 OK',
    'Set-Cookie' => 'tasty_cookie=strawberry',
  ]

  # Since 3.0.0-alpha
  [
    'Status' => [
      'HTTP/2 200 OK',
    ],
    'Set-Cookie' => [
      'yummy_cookie=choco',
      'tasty_cookie=strawberry',
    ],
  ]
  ```

* Method `Response#getHeader(string $headerKey) : array` will now return an array containing all values for the given
  header key to support multi-value headers. Previous versions returned the last value as a string.
  ```php
  echo $response->getHeader('Set-Cookie');
  
  # Previous versions
  'tasty_cookie=strawberry'

  # Since 3.0.0-alpha
  [
    'yummy_cookie=choco',
    'tasty_cookie=strawberry'
  ]
  ```

* Method `Response#getRawResponse() : string` is no longer available and its usage must be replaced
  with `Response#getOutput()`. The method was deprecated since version [2.6.0](#260---2019-04-02).

### Added

* Method `Response#getHeaderLine(string $headerKey) : string` that returns all values, separated by comma, for the given
  key. - [#35]
* Header keys are now case-insensitive in `Response#getHeader(string $headerKey) : array`
  and `Response#getHeaderLine(string $headerKey) : string`. - [#35]

### Removed

* Method `Response#getRawResponse() : string` that was deprecated in version [2.6.0](#260---2019-04-02) in favour
  of `Response#getOutput() : string`. - [#36]

## [2.7.2] - 2019-05-31

### Improved

* Handling of `stream_select` returning `false` in case of a system call interrupt. - [#41]

### Fixed

* Remove/close sockets after fetching their responses triggered async requests in order to prevent halt on further
  request processing, if the number of requests exceeds php-fpm's `pm.max_children` setting. - [#40]

## [2.7.1] - 2019-04-29

### Fixed

* Remove failed sockets from internal collection that errored out during reading of response in order to prevent
  infinite tries/re-use of those failed connections. - [#37]

## [2.7.0] - 2019-04-28

### Added

* Re-using of idle sockets for successive requests - [#33]

## [2.6.0] - 2019-04-02

### Added

* Two new methods to Response class - [#27]
  * `Response#getOutput()` which is identical to `Response#getRawResponse()` and will return the complete output from
    the `STDOUT` stream of the response.
  * `Response#getError()` which will return the complete output of the `STDERR` stream of the response.

* Second parameter `$errorBuffer` in tha pass through callback signature - [#27]
  ```php
  $callback = function( string $outputBuffer, string $errorBuffer ) {};
  ```
  This parameter will contain the contents of the `STDERR` stream packets.

### Deprecated

* `Response#getRawResponse()` in favour of consistant naming. This method will be removed in `v3.0.0` - [#27]

### Removed

* `ProcessManagerException` that was introduced in `v2.5.0` - [#27]
  Please read [this blog post](https://hollo.me/php/background-info-fast-cgi-client-v2.6.0.html) why this (BC breaking)
  change was necessary and how to handle server-sent errors now.

### Fixed

* `bin/fcgiget` to accept full URL paths and print STDOUT and STDERR output

### Improved

* Documentation

## [2.5.0] - 2019-01-29

### Added

* New `ProcessManagerException` in case the php-fpm responds with packages of type `STDERR`. This refers mainly to the
  error `Primary script unknown` resp. the response `File not found.`.
  - [#26]

* CI builds for PHP 7.3

## [2.4.3] - 2018-09-17

### Fixes

* Value of Client::STREAM_SELECT_USEC was to low with `20000` and was updated to `200000` as
  [recommended in the official PHP documentation](http://php.net/stream_select#tv_sec). - [#20]

## [2.4.2] - 2018-01-28

### Fixes

* Missing data in `php://input` on worker side when client sends content larger than 65535 bytes - [#15]

## [2.4.1] - 2017-11-19

### Fixes

* PHP warning when trying to get ready request IDs - [#14]

### Improves

* Loop performance

## [2.4.0] - 2017-09-28

### Added

* Ability to add pass through callbacks in order to access output buffer from a long running callee - [#11]  
  See
  an [example in the documentation](./README.md#reading-output-buffer-from-worker-script-using-pass-through-callbacks)
  for further informaiton.

## [2.3.0] - 2017-06-15

### Changed

* Replaced methods `getHost()` and `getPort()` with `getSocketAddress()` in
  interface `hollodotme\FastCGI\Interfaces\ConfiguresSocketConnection` - [#9]
* The transport protocol `unix://` must be omitted for the first parameter
  of `hollodotme\FastCGI\SocketConnections\UnixDomainSocket`  
  Only the socket path must be passed. - [#9]
* Replaced `fsockopen()` with `stream_socket_client()` for connecting to php-fpm. - [#9]

## [2.2.0] - 2017-04-15

### Added

* Method `addResponseCallbacks(callable ...$callbacks)` to all request classes to enable response evaluation delegation
  - [#6]
* Method `addFailureCallbacks(callable ...$callbacks)` to all request classes to enable exception handling delegation
* Method `readResponse(int $requestId, ?int $timeoutMs = null) : ProvidesResponseData` to read and retrieve a single
  response
* Method `readResponses(?int $imeoutMs = null, int ...$requestIds) : \Generator` to read and yield multiple responses
* Method `readReadyResponses(?int $imeoutMs = null) : \Generator` to check for ready responses, read and yield them
* Method `waitForResponses(?int $timeout = null)` to `Client` class for waiting for multiple responses and calling the
  respective response callbacks - [#5]
* Method `getRequestIdsHavingResponse() : array` to enable reactive read of responses as they occur
* Method `hasUnhandledResponses() : bool` to check for outstanding responses
* Method `handleResponse(int $requestId, ?int $timeoutMs = null)` to fetch a specific response and notify the respective
  response callback
* Method `handleResponses(?int $timeoutMs = null, int ...$requestIds)` to fetch a specific responses and notify the
  respective response callbacks
* Method `handleReadyResponses(?int $timeoutMs = null)` to check for ready responses, fetch them and notify the
  respective response callbacks

### Changed

* Method `waitForResponse(int $requestId, ?int $timeoutMs = null)` is not returning a response anymore, but will call
  the response callback  
  Use `readResponse(int $requestId, ?int $timeoutMs = null): ProvidesResponseData` if you want to get the response
  directly.

### Removed

* Optional flag to make a connection persistent (is now always disabled in favour of better timeout handling and FPM
  pool-children-scalability)
* Optional flag to keep the server-side connection alive (is now always enabled, affects only network sockets)

### Improved

* Code coverage by automated integration tests
* Timeout handling on multiple requests

## [2.1.0] - 2017-03-07

### Added

* Public class constants for request methods `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`
  in `hollodotme\FastCGI\Constants\RequestMethod` - [#5]
* Public class constants for server protocols `HTTP/1.0` and `HTTP/1.1` in `hollodotme\FastCGI\Constants\ServerProtocol`
  - [#5]
